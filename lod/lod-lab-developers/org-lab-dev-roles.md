# Lab Developer Roles

When developing labs on Lab On Demand (LOD), various development functions will require different permissions. If you are an Organization Administrator, this guide will cover which roles are needed for lab developers to utilize certain features. 

## Philosophy

The Organization Lab Developer role set on LOD uses an additive model where common functions are enabled by **Base Roles**, and additional functionality is given via **Supplemental Roles**. This allows for modular customization of permissions for an Organization while giving developers the specific permissions needed for their workflow.

1. Go to the user's profile.
2. Select **Edit**.
3. Select the **Managed Organizations** tab.
4. Select **+ Add Organization**.
